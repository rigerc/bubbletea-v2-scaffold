## Mission
Deliver correct, maintainable changes with minimal risk.

## Scope
- Respect repository architecture and conventions.
- Keep edits focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Never commit secrets.

## Engineering Rules
- Validate changes with relevant checks before final delivery.
- Surface assumptions and edge cases explicitly.
- Prefer reversible changes and deterministic outputs.

## Workflow
1. Plan briefly.
2. Implement minimal viable change.
3. Validate (lint/tests/build/smoke as needed).
4. Report results and residual risks.
